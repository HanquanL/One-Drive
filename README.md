# One*Drive Cloud Storage
You have been hired by Super*Duper*Drive, which is a brand new company aiming to make a dent in the Cloud Storage market and is already facing stiff competition from rivals like Google Drive and Dropbox. That hasn't dampened their spirits at all, however. They want to include personal information management features in their application to differentiate them from the competition, and the minimum viable product includes three user-facing features:

1. **Simple File Storage:** Upload/download/remove files
2. **Note Management:** Add/update/remove text notes
3. **Password Management:** Save, edit, and delete website credentials.  

One*Drive wants you to focus on building the web application with the skills you acquired in this course. That means you are responsible for developing the server, website, and tests, but other tasks like deployment belong to other teams at the company. 

## Starter Project
A senior developer is assigned to be your tech lead and mentor, and they put together a starter project for you. It's a Maven project configured for all the dependencies the project requires, though you should feel free to add any additional dependencies you might require. [You can download or clone the starter repository here](https://github.com/udacity/nd035-c1-spring-boot-basics-project-starter/tree/master/starter/cloudstorage).

Your tech lead already designed a database schema for the project and has added it to the `src/main/resources` directory. That means you don't have to design the database, only develop the Java code to interact with it. 

Your tech lead also created some HTML templates from the design team's website mockups, and they placed them in the `src/main/resources/templates` folder. These are static pages right now, and you have to configure them with Thymeleaf to add functionality and real data from the server you develop. You may also have to change them to support testing the application.

From the link above, you can download the starter code and open it as a Maven project in IntelliJ.
